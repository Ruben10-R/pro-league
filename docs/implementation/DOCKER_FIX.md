# ðŸ”§ Docker Fix - Frontend next-intl Module Issue

## Problem
After implementing the authentication and i18n features, the frontend Docker container failed to start with:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'next-intl/plugin'
```

## Root Cause
The `next-intl` package was installed locally (via `npm install` in the frontend directory) but the Docker container was built before this dependency was added. Docker containers use cached layers and don't automatically pick up new dependencies.

## Solution
Rebuilt the frontend Docker container without cache to include the new `next-intl` dependency:

```bash
# 1. Stop the frontend container
docker compose down frontend

# 2. Rebuild without cache to ensure fresh install
docker compose build --no-cache frontend

# 3. Start the frontend container
docker compose up -d frontend
```

## Result
âœ… Frontend container now starts successfully  
âœ… Next.js compiles middleware in ~4s  
âœ… Application ready in ~6s  
âœ… All containers healthy and running  

## Container Status
```
NAME                    STATUS
pro-league-backend-1    Up and healthy (port 3333)
pro-league-frontend-1   Up and healthy (port 3000)
pro-league-mysql-1      Up and healthy (port 3306)
pro-league-shared-1     Up and healthy
```

## Testing
You can now access the application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3333
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:3333/docs

## Important Note
Whenever you add new npm dependencies to any workspace (frontend, backend, or shared), you need to:

1. **Rebuild the affected Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache <service-name>
   ```

2. **Or rebuild all containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose build --no-cache
   ```

3. **Then restart**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Prevention
To avoid this issue in the future, you can:

1. **Always rebuild after dependency changes**:
   ```bash
   npm install <package>
   docker compose build --no-cache <service>
   ```

2. **Use a Docker development workflow** with volume mounts for node_modules (already configured in docker-compose.yml)

3. **Run `docker compose build` before `docker compose up`** after pulling changes

## Verification
Check the frontend logs to confirm it's working:
```bash
docker compose logs frontend --tail=20
```

Expected output:
```
âœ“ Compiled middleware in 3.9s
âœ“ Ready in 5.9s
```

**Status**: âœ… Fixed and verified
**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Time to Fix**: ~2 minutes (rebuild + start)
