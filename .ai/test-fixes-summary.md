# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Test Database Cleanup
**Problem**: Tests were using `testUtils.db().seed()` in setup which was causing duplicate user errors (409 status codes) because previous test data persisted.

**Solution**: 
- Removed `seed()` calls from test setup
- Changed to use only `truncate()` to ensure a clean database before each test
- Removed unnecessary `teardown()` hooks

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/tests/functional/auth/login.spec.ts`
- `backend/tests/functional/auth/logout.spec.ts`
- `backend/tests/functional/auth/me.spec.ts`
- `backend/tests/functional/auth/register.spec.ts`

### 2. Token Acquisition Pattern
**Problem**: Tests were trying to get tokens from register responses using `registerResponse.body().data.token.token`, but then expecting the token to work for authenticated requests. This was failing because:
- Some tests were written assuming register doesn't return a token
- Database state was inconsistent due to seeding

**Solution**: 
- Updated tests to explicitly login after registration when a token is needed
- Changed pattern from:
  ```typescript
  const registerResponse = await client.post('/api/auth/register').json({...})
  const token = registerResponse.body().data.token.token
  ```
- To:
  ```typescript
  await client.post('/api/auth/register').json({...})
  const loginResponse = await client.post('/api/auth/login').json({...})
  const token = loginResponse.body().data.token.token
  ```

**Affected Tests**:
- `Auth - Logout / should logout authenticated user`
- `Auth - Logout / should invalidate token after logout`
- `Auth - Me / should get current user data`
- `Auth - Me / should reject request with expired/revoked token`

### 3. HTTP Status Code Expectations
**Problem**: Tests expected different status codes for validation errors
- Some expected 400 (Bad Request)
- Some expected 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
- AdonisJS validation returns 422 by default

**Solution**: Updated all validation error assertions to expect 422 status code consistently

**Note**: The actual backend behavior was correct; only test expectations needed adjustment.

## Test Suite Structure

All auth tests now follow this pattern:

```typescript
test.group('Auth - [Feature]', (group) => {
  group.each.setup(async () => {
    await testUtils.db().truncate()  // Clean database before each test
  })
  
  group.tap((test) => test.tags(['@auth', '@feature']))
  
  // ... test cases
})
```

## CI/CD Integration

The tests are configured to run in GitHub Actions with:
- MySQL 8.0 service container
- Proper environment variables from `.env.test.example`
- Database migrations run before tests
- Separate unit and functional test runs

## Test Coverage

Current test suites:
- **Health Check**: 1 test
- **Auth - Login**: 7 tests
- **Auth - Logout**: 4 tests
- **Auth - Me**: 4 tests
- **Auth - Register**: 9 tests

**Total**: 25 tests covering authentication flows including:
- User registration with validation
- User login with credential verification
- Token-based authentication
- User profile retrieval
- Logout and token invalidation
- Edge cases (duplicate emails, invalid inputs, missing fields)
